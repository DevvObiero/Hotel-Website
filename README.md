# Hotel-Website
home page of hotel website personal project
I havent learnt javascript yet to finish the first part of "project H"(cool name,thank youðŸ˜Ž)once I learn javascript DOM manipulation I'
 add automatic switching from tab to tab in every 6/7 seconds


 I'm also thinking about adding a navigation bar to the landing page,I know html and css are enough to make one I can start with so I'll do that tonight!(from tonight,I )


 It'd be nice to have some attractive text for the landing page too,i just saw the one for kempinksi's website.
